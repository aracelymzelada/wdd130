     <p>Tikal, an ancient Maya city in Guatemala, sits deep in the rainforest, surrounded by towering trees and exotic wildlife. Its climate is hot and humid year-round, with temperatures reaching up to 37Â°C (98Â°F) in April and cooling to 30Â°C (86Â°F) in January. The site features massive pyramids, including Temple IV, which stands 70 meters (230 feet) high, offering breathtaking views over the jungle canopy. Heavy rainfall is common, especially in June and September, making the ruins even more mystical</p>
